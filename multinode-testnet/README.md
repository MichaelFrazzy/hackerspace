# Multinode Testnet Community Initiative

This folder serves as a centralized location for scripts, genesis configurations, snippets, and tools used in a multinode testnet community initiative.

## Objective

The goal of this initiative is to establish a multinode testnet focused on multivalidator experimentations, including stability, benchmarking, and lifecycle management. While we currently maintain the single-node test3+.gno.land setup, which is primarily dedicated to showcasing the VM and providing examples, this multinode testnet aims to provide a platform for in-depth explorations and evaluations of multivalidator setups.

We encourage active participation from the community to collaborate on refining the multinode testnet, sharing insights, and collectively advancing the knowledge and understanding of multivalidator systems.

Let's embark on this journey together, pushing the boundaries of multivalidator technologies and enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of our network infrastructure.
